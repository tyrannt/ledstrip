A number of RGB, individually-addressable LED strips have appeared on the market built around the HL1606 driver chip.   This chip allows for individual control of the LEDs on the strip and also supports fade-in/fade-out control using its own internally-clocked 7-bit-per-channel PWM.

This project is to provide an Arduino library to drive RGB strips which use this chip.
